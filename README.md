This project, as part of The Odin Project course, will display my javascript skills by creating a rock, paper, scissors game that the user can play against the computer. 

In order to personalize the game and follow a more magical theme, I have changed the choices to "Charm, Cordial, Curse", yet the overall logic remains the same.
